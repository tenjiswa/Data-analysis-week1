WHAT IS DATA ANALYTICS?
Process of analysis raw data so we can pull out insights useful to companies, these insights are super important to drive smart important business decisions.
In other words you can describe it as business intelligence used to solve companies challenges.\

HOW IS DATA ANALYTICS USED?
It is used to make faster, better business decisions, It is also used to reduce overall business costs and to develop new and innovative products and services.
IN REAL WORLD DATA ANALYTICS MAY BE USED FOR:
1.To predict future sales for purchasing behaviours
2.To help and protect against fraud(security purposes)
3.To analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
4.To boost customer acquisition and retention
5.Toincrease supply chain efficiency

WHAT DOES A DATA ANALYST ACTUALLY DO?
Responsibilities include:
1.Manage the delivery of users satisfaction surveys and report on results using data visualization software.
2.Working with business line owners to develop requirements,define success metrics, manage and execute analytical projects and evaluate results
3.Monitor practices,processes and systems to identify opportunuities for improvement
4.Translate important questions into concrete analytical tasks
5.Gather new data to answer client questions, collating and organizing data from multiple sources
6.Design,build,test and maintain backend code
7.Establish data processes,define data quality criteria and implement data quality processes
8.Work as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key data that will be used to shape future strategies.

TYPICAL PROCESS OF DATA ANALYST
Step 1:Define the questions that you want to answer(problem and hypothesis)
Step 2:Collect the data(gather data from primary sources)
Step 3:Clean the data
Step 4:Analyse the data
Step 5:Interpret and share the results

THREE MAJOR PILLARS THAT COME TOGETHER TO ALLOW ANALYTICS PROGRAMS TO THRIVE
1.Data
2.Storage
3.Computing power
Process they move through as they acquire new data,clean and manipulate that data, analyze it,create visualizations and then report and communicate their results to
business leaders.

        Data Aquisition
             \
       Cleaning and Manipulation
              \
          Analysis
              \
        Visualization
              \
      Reporting and communication

THE ANALYTICS PROCESS IS ITERATIVE
While we describe the steps of the analytics as series of sequential actions,it is more accurate to think of them as a set of inter-related actions that may be revisted frequently
while working with a dataset.
This process is meant to help you understand the different activities that take place during a data analysis effort and approximate order in which they typically occur.

ANALYTICS TECHNIQUES
Analyst use a varietyof techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ANALYTICS TECHNIQUES
1.Descriptive Analytics
2.Predictive Analytics
3.Prescriptive Analytics

MACHINE LEARNING:Uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help you make informed decisions about the future.
CASES WHERE MACHINE LEARNING COMMONLY ADDS VALUE
1.Segmenting customers and determing the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups
2.Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident
3.Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions
4.Recommending the next movie that a customer might wish to watch based on their past activity and the preferences of similar customers
5.Setting prices for hotel rooms far in advance based on forecasted demand.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to initiate  human behavior.
MACHINE LEARNING(ML) is a subset of AI techniques.ML techniques attempt to apply statics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.

DEEP LEARNING:Is further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques,known as neural networks,to discover knowledge in a particular way it is highly specialized
subfield of machine learning that is commonly used for image,video and sound analysis
