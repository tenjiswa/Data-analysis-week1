# WHAT IS DATA ANALYTICS?
Process of analysis raw data so we can pull out insights useful to companies, these insights are super important to drive smart important business decisions.
In other words you can describe it as business intelligence used to solve companies challenges.\

# HOW IS DATA ANALYTICS USED?
It is used to make faster, better business decisions, It is also used to reduce overall business costs and to develop new and innovative products and services.
 IN REAL WORLD DATA ANALYTICS MAY BE USED FOR:
1.To predict future sales for purchasing behaviours
2.To help and protect against fraud(security purposes)
3.To analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
4.To boost customer acquisition and retention
5.Toincrease supply chain efficiency

# WHAT DOES A DATA ANALYST ACTUALLY DO?
Responsibilities include:
1.Manage the delivery of users satisfaction surveys and report on results using data visualization software.
2.Working with business line owners to develop requirements,define success metrics, manage and execute analytical projects and evaluate results
3.Monitor practices,processes and systems to identify opportunuities for improvement
4.Translate important questions into concrete analytical tasks
5.Gather new data to answer client questions, collating and organizing data from multiple sources
6.Design,build,test and maintain backend code
7.Establish data processes,define data quality criteria and implement data quality processes
8.Work as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key data that will be used to shape future strategies.

# TYPICAL PROCESS OF DATA ANALYST
Step 1:Define the questions that you want to answer(problem and hypothesis)
Step 2:Collect the data(gather data from primary sources)
Step 3:Clean the data
Step 4:Analyse the data
Step 5:Interpret and share the results

# THREE MAJOR PILLARS THAT COME TOGETHER TO ALLOW ANALYTICS PROGRAMS TO THRIVE
1.Data
2.Storage
3.Computing power
# Process they move through as they acquire new data,clean and manipulate that data, analyze it,create visualizations and then report and communicate their results to
# business leaders.

       Cleaning and Manipulation

      Reporting and communication

# THE ANALYTICS PROCESS IS ITERATIVE
While we describe the steps of the analytics as series of sequential actions,it is more accurate to think of them as a set of inter-related actions that may be revisted frequently
while working with a dataset.
This process is meant to help you understand the different activities that take place during a data analysis effort and approximate order in which they typically occur.

# ANALYTICS TECHNIQUES
Analyst use a varietyof techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
# MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ANALYTICS TECHNIQUES
1.Descriptive Analytics
2.Predictive Analytics
3.Prescriptive Analytics

# MACHINE LEARNING:Uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help you make informed decisions about the future.
CASES WHERE MACHINE LEARNING COMMONLY ADDS VALUE
1.Segmenting customers and determing the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups
2.Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident
3.Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions
4.Recommending the next movie that a customer might wish to watch based on their past activity and the preferences of similar customers
5.Setting prices for hotel rooms far in advance based on forecasted demand.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to initiate  human behavior.
 MACHINE LEARNING(ML) is a subset of AI techniques.ML techniques attempt to apply statics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.

DEEP LEARNING:Is further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques,known as neural networks,to discover knowledge in a particular way it is highly specialized
subfield of machine learning that is commonly used for image,video and sound analysis.

DATA GOVERNANCE
Ensures that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control data.

# ANALYTICS TOOL
Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process. These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to aquire,
clean,manipulate,visualize and analyze data.They also provide invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results.

# CHAPTER TWO EXPLORING DATA TYPES
A data element is an attribute about a person,place or thing containing data within a range of values.Data elements also describe characteristics of activities including orders,transactions and events.
A data type limits the values a data element can have.
TUBULAR DATA : is data organized into a table,made up of columns and rows

STRUCTURED DATA TYPES
Is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns, structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreedsheet.
CHARACTER DATA TYPE
Limits data entry to only valid characters.characters can include the alphabet than you might see on your keyboard,as well as numbers.
# Alphanumeric
is the most widely used data types for storing character-based data.As the name implies alphanumeric is appropriate when data element consists of both numbers and letter examples include
address field,to accurately represent a given street address, both the house number and street name is required.

# CHARACTER SETS 
Database uses character sets to map or encodedata and store it digitally.ASCII accomodates both the upper and lowercase English alphabet and numbers,mathematical operators and symbols.
STRONG AND WEAK TYPING
Datatype define values placed in clumns.Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types.
A database column defined as numeric only accepts numeric values.You get an error if you attempt to enter characters into numeric column.
# Weak typing 
loosely enforces data types.Spreadsheets use weak typing to help make it easier for people to accomplish their work.
UNSTRUCTURED DATA TYPES-is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model.Examples include digital images,audio recordings,video recordings and open-ended survey-responses.
Semi-Structured data represents the space between structured spreadsheets and unstructured videos.

# QUANTITATIVE DATA
1.Consists of numeric values
2.Data elements whose values comes from counting or measuring e.g height and weight
3.Answers questions like "How many?" and "how much?"

# QUALITATIVE DATA
1.Consists of frequent text values
2.Data elements whose values describe characteristics,traits and attitude are all qualitative e.g PetName,Animal Type and Breed Name
3.Answers questions like "why?" and "what?"

# DISCRETE 
1.Represents measurements that can't be subdivided.
2.Whole numbers represent discrete data
3.Qualitative data is descrete data

# CONTINUOUS DATA
1.When you measure things like height and weight
2.Quantitative data can be either discrete or continuous data

# TEXT FILES
Text files are one of the most commonly used data file formats. As the name implies, they consist of plain text and are limited in scope to alphanumeric data. One of the reasons text files are so widely adopted is their ability to be opened regardless of platform or operating system without needing a proprietary piece of software. 
Whether you are using a Microsoft Windows desktop, an Apple MacBook, or a Linux server, you can easily open a text file. Text files are also commonly referred to as flat files.


A unique character known as a delimiter facilitates transmitting structured data via a text file. The delimiter is the character that separates individual fields. A delimiter can be any character. Over the years, the comma and tab grew into a widely accepted standard. 
Various software packages support reading and writing delimited files using the comma and the tab. In addition, many coding languages have libraries that make it easy to write comma- or tab-delimited files. 
When a file is comma-delimited, it is known as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Similarly, when a file is tab-delimited, it is called a tab-separated values (TSV) file.
